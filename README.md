## üìå Overview
This project is my solution to the AltSchool Cloud Engineering Semester 3, Month 2 assessment.  
The goal was to deploy **InnovateMart‚Äôs Retail Store Application** to AWS **Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)** with automation, security, and scalability best practices.  

The implementation covers:  
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform  
- **Kubernetes deployment** of microservices  
- **CI/CD automation** with GitHub Actions  
- **IAM roles and developer access**  

---

## üöÄ Step 1: Provisioning Infrastructure with Terraform
1. Created a **VPC** and stored the variables in `terraform.tfvars` with all dependencies like route tables, subnets, and gateways attached.

2. Provisioned **EKS cluster**:  
   - Cluster Name: `innovatemart-cluster`  
   - Kubernetes Version: `1.30`  
   - Node Group: `t3.small`  
   - Desired: 2, Min: 2, Max: 4

3. Created **IAM roles & policies** for:  
   - EKS cluster  
   - Node group  
   - Read-only developer user

## üåê Step 2: Deploying the Retail Store Application
- Applied the `kubernetes.yaml` file to deploy the microservices.  
- Retrieved the **LoadBalancer URL** with:  
  ```bash
  kubectl get svc
Copied the URL and confirmed the UI was accessible.

‚öôÔ∏è Step 3: CI/CD Automation

Created a GitHub Actions workflow under .github/workflows to automate the Terraform process.

Defined steps for:

Initializing Terraform

Running terraform plan for feature branches

Running terraform apply for the main branch

Using GitHub Secrets to manage AWS credentials securely

üîë Step 4: Developer Access & Manual Validation

Manually verified that everything was working correctly.

Logged in with the read-only IAM user created for the instructor to confirm:

Able to list pods, view logs, and check services ‚úÖ

Unable to make changes ‚ùå

Verified node groups and access entries:

‚úÖ Verification

EKS cluster successfully provisioned via Terraform.

Retail Store Application deployed and accessible via LoadBalancer URL.

CI/CD pipeline validated by GitHub Actions runs.

Read-only developer user tested and confirmed with limited access.
